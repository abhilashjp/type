Every year air pollution becomes a major issue across North India during winters. It was during the winter season of 2015, me and my friend (roommate during that time) decided to buy an air purifier. When we started exploring options, we soon realized that the options available are expensive. 

When we read more about the air purifier we came to know that the components required to build an air purifier is fairly simple and can be sourced from different manufactures with hustle efforts.  

We couldn’t let go the fact that the high prices for the air purifiers were due to marketing and branding. This led us to the idea of creating an affordable air purifier for everyone. Thus we started researching more on this and tried building some prototypes over the next couple of months. 

Here is how our initial test models looked like.

We named our enterprise "Saafair". ‘Saaf’ in Hindi means clean, thus the word translates to “Clean air”.
