Every year air pollution becomes a major issue across North India during winters. It was during the winter season of 2015, me and my friend (roommate during that time) decided to buy an air purifier. When we started exploring options, we soon realized that the options available are expensive. 

When we read more about the air purifier we came to know that the components required to build an air purifier is fairly simple and can be sourced from different manufactures with hustle efforts.  

We couldn’t let go the fact that the high prices for the air purifiers were due to marketing and branding. This led us to the idea of creating an affordable air purifier for everyone. Thus we started researching more on this and tried building some prototypes over the next couple of months. 

Here is how our initial prototypes looked like.

We named our enterprise "Saafair". ‘Saaf’ in Hindi means clean, thus the word translates to “Clean air”.

Our idea was to sell low-cost air purifiers with a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.in/Honeywell-HCMF25M0012-Compound-Filter-Activated/dp/B076HP91MN/ref=sr_1_8?crid=2M09A665Y2AVC&_encoding=UTF8&tag=ajp092-21&linkCode=ur2&linkId=d17da978220324128b8eea1140df223e&camp=3638&creative=24630">Hepa filter </a>  and a fresh air fan. We did some hustle and tied up with OEMs for Hepa filters and other related components. We also purchased an air pollution monitor. The first one we bought was found to be inaccurate and hence we had to import another one by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.in/Dylos-DC1100-Pro-quality-monitor/dp/B004AWEG0Y?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=ajp092-21&linkCode=ur2&linkId=3d7598df10bab96c35bbfda6e0d8d897&camp=3638&creative=24630">Dylos, DC1100 Pro Air Quality Monitor </a> via one of our relatives in Canada.

Finally we launched our first 2 models in September 2016

1. Kosher - Our Flagship model. But still rudimentary in terms of current standards. 
2. Puro - a DIY model with just a table Fan and a HEPA

I also quickly launched a magento website to sell online under the domain saafair.com. Along with these we also started selling N95 Masks and Carbon Mask. We also tried selling indoor plants under the category clean air plants. 

Initially we ran the sales with the help of word of mouth. Slowly we started gathering traction. During this time we luckily we got some good media media coverage. This was a tipping point for us as it immediately boosted our sales. We also started getting inbound calls for investments.

Things were getting serious now. We had to decide on the way forward for Saafair. We were competing against popular brands. These brands were selling the same item in a more aesthetically pleasing manner. We could have easily sold a couple of thousand orders. We had also found our Power Users in ‘people with breathing troubles’ due to heavy air pollution. Since the HEPA filters also had a shelf life of 3 to 4 months, we also had a subscription model in place for replacing the filters for the purifiers. 

As we scaled it became more clear to us that we need to we need to redesign it to make more appealing. Our users should feel confident in displaying to others may be by placing it the front room. We had to move away from our existing sheet metal model to a Plastic based mold. 

The since cost was our only advantage, these brands could easily out compete us with heavy discounting any day. We were not an experts in any of the areas including manufacturing, supply chain or even marketing. What we had was curiosity and a drive to build things. We could have continued the same without scaling for a couple of years.
