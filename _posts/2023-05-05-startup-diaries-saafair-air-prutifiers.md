Every year air pollution becomes a major issue across North India during winters. It was during the winter season of 2015, me and my friend (roommate during that time) decided to buy an air purifier. When we started exploring options, we soon realized that the options available are expensive. 

When we read more about the air purifier we came to know that the components required to build an air purifier is fairly simple and can be sourced from different manufactures with hustle efforts.  

We couldn’t let go the fact that the high prices for the air purifiers were due to marketing and branding. This led us to the idea of creating an affordable air purifier for everyone. Thus we started researching more on this and tried building some prototypes over the next couple of months. 

Here is how our initial prototypes looked like.

  </td></tr>
  <tr><td colspan="2" align="center"> Kosher Prototype </td></tr>

We named our enterprise "Saafair". ‘Saaf’ in Hindi means clean, thus the word translates to “Clean air”.

Our idea was to sell low-cost air purifiers with a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.in/Honeywell-HCMF25M0012-Compound-Filter-Activated/dp/B076HP91MN/ref=sr_1_8?crid=2M09A665Y2AVC&_encoding=UTF8&tag=ajp092-21&linkCode=ur2&linkId=d17da978220324128b8eea1140df223e&camp=3638&creative=24630">Hepa filter </a>  and a fresh air fan. We did some hustle and tied up with OEMs for Hepa filters and other related components. We also purchased an air pollution monitor. The first one we bought was found to be inaccurate and hence we had to import another one by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.in/Dylos-DC1100-Pro-quality-monitor/dp/B004AWEG0Y?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=ajp092-21&linkCode=ur2&linkId=3d7598df10bab96c35bbfda6e0d8d897&camp=3638&creative=24630">Dylos, DC1100 Pro Air Quality Monitor </a> via one of our relatives in Canada.


Finally we launched our first 2 models in September 2016

1. Kosher - Our Flagship model. But still rudimentary in terms of current standards. 
2. Puro - a DIY model with just a table Fan and a HEPA
