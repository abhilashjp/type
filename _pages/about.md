 Hi, there.

 I’m Abhilash John Philip. I’m a Product Management Professional. I am currently working as a Senior Product Manager at <a href="http://chargebee.com/" target="_blank">Chargebee</a> where I own the Taxation product. 
 
 I have worked with  PayU, Housing.com & Industrybuying.com in my previous roles. I also cofounded a company during my college days. It later got acqui-hired by Clairvolex IP Solutions. You can read more about our early days [here](https://onstrangertides.blog/2017/09/28/startup-diaries-hedcet/).

 My interests range from entrepreneurship, technology to public policy. You can read more about my work on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhilashjohnphilip)
